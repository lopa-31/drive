## Building a Unified Android SDK: A Step-by-Step Guide to Merging Modules and Hiding Internal Code

For Android developers managing multi-module projects, the need to create a single, streamlined SDK is a common challenge. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to building a single Android Archive (AAR) from multiple library modules, while ensuring that only the designated public API of your core library is exposed to the end-user. This method effectively hides the implementation details of your internal libraries, offering a clean and secure SDK distribution.

This process will utilize a "fat AAR" approach, which involves bundling multiple modules into a single AAR file. We will also leverage ProGuard for code obfuscation and Kotlin's visibility modifiers to control API exposure.

### Project Structure Overview

For this guide, we will assume the following module structure:

*   `:app`: The main application module used for testing the SDK.
*   `:core`: The public-facing library module that serves as the entry point to the SDK.
*   `:capture`, `:network`, `:security`, `:embedding`, `:utility`: Internal library modules that are dependencies of the `:core` module.

The goal is to create a single AAR file that includes all the functionality from `:core` and its internal dependencies, while only making the public functions and classes of `:core` accessible.

### Step 1: Configuring Your `build.gradle` Files

The first step is to correctly configure the Gradle dependencies in your project. The `:core` module needs to declare its dependencies on the internal library modules.

**In your `:core` module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file, add the following dependencies:**

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies

    // Declare dependencies on internal library modules
    implementation(project(":capture"))
    implementation(project(":network"))
    implementation(project(":security"))
    implementation(project(":embedding"))
    implementation(project(":utility"))
}
```

This ensures that the code and resources from the internal modules are included when the `:core` module is built.

### Step 2: Implementing a "Fat AAR" Solution

To combine all your library modules into a single AAR, you will need to use a Gradle plugin designed for this purpose. A popular and effective option is the "fat-aar-android" plugin.

**1. Add the plugin to your project's root `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file:**

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.github.kezong:fat-aar:1.3.8")
    }
}
```

**2. Apply the plugin in your `:core` module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file:**

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.library")
    kotlin("android")
    id("com.kezong.fat-aar")
}
```

**3. Configure the dependencies to be embedded:**

In your `:core` module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`), change the `implementation` dependency type to `embed` for the internal library modules. This tells the "fat-aar" plugin to include these modules in the final AAR.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies

    embed(project(":capture"))
    embed(project(":network"))
    embed(project(":security"))
    embed(project(":embedding"))
    embed(project(":utility"))
}
```

Now, when you build the `:core` module, Gradle will generate a single AAR file in the `build/outputs/aar/` directory that contains the compiled code and resources from `:core` and all its embedded dependencies.

### Step 3: Hiding Internal Code with ProGuard and Visibility Modifiers

The next crucial step is to hide the implementation details of the internal modules and only expose the public API of the `:core` module. This can be achieved through a combination of ProGuard for obfuscation and Kotlin's `internal` visibility modifier.

#### Utilizing Kotlin's `internal` Visibility

In your internal library modules (`:capture`, `:network`, `:security`, `:embedding`, `:utility`), declare all classes, functions, and properties that should not be part of the public SDK as `internal`. The `internal` modifier makes the declaration visible only within the same Gradle module.

**Example in an internal module (e.g., `:network`):**

```kotlin
// This class will not be directly accessible to the end-user of the SDK
internal class NetworkClient {
    // ...
}
```

In your `:core` module, you will still be able to access these `internal` members because they are in the same compilation unit. However, once the AAR is generated and consumed by a third-party app, these `internal` declarations will not be accessible.

#### Configuring ProGuard for Obfuscation and API Exposure

ProGuard is a powerful tool for shrinking, optimizing, and obfuscating your code. In this context, we'll use it to obfuscate the internal library code and ensure only the intended public API of the `:core` module remains accessible.

**1. Enable ProGuard in your `:core` module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file:**

```kotlin
android {
    // ...
    buildTypes {
        getByName("release") {
            isMinifyEnabled = true
            proguardFiles(
                getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"),
                "proguard-rules.pro"
            )
        }
    }
}```

**2. Create a `proguard-rules.pro` file in your `:core` module.**

**3. Add ProGuard rules to `proguard-rules.pro` to:**

*   **Keep the public API of your `:core` module:** You need to explicitly tell ProGuard not to obfuscate or remove the classes and methods that are part of your public SDK.

    ```proguard
    # Keep all public classes and their public members in the core module's public API package
    -keep public class com.your.sdk.core.api.** {
        public *;
    }
    ```

*   **Allow obfuscation of all other code:** By not explicitly keeping the internal modules' code, ProGuard will obfuscate their class and method names, making them difficult to understand and use.

    ```proguard
    # Repackage all other classes into an internal package (optional but recommended)
    -repackageclasses 'com.your.sdk.internal'
    ```

This configuration ensures that only the classes within the `com.your.sdk.core.api` package (or whichever package you define for your public API) are preserved with their original names, while all the internal implementation details from `:core` and the other modules are obfuscated.

### Step 4: Building and Testing the SDK

With the Gradle configurations and ProGuard rules in place, you can now build your SDK.

1.  **Build the AAR:** Run the Gradle build task for your `:core` module. You can do this from the command line:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew :core:assembleRelease
    ```

    This will generate the fat AAR in the `:core/build/outputs/aar/` directory.

2.  **Test the AAR:** To ensure your SDK works as expected and that the internal code is properly hidden, you can include it as a local dependency in a separate test application.

    *   Copy the generated AAR file into the `libs` directory of your test application.
    *   In the test app's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`), add the following dependency:

        ```kotlin
        dependencies {
            implementation(files("libs/core-release.aar"))
        }
        ```

    *   Attempt to access the public API from your `:core` module. This should work as expected.
    *   Attempt to access any of the classes or methods from your internal modules. You should find that they are either not visible or have been obfuscated, making them unusable.
 
By following these steps, you can successfully build a single, unified Gradle SDK from a multi-module Android project. This approach not only simplifies the distribution of your library but also provides a strong layer of protection for your internal code, ensuring a clean and secure API for your end-users.

Of course. The error message you're seeing is a classic sign of a plugin incompatibility, and it's a very common issue in the Android ecosystem.

Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it.

### Understanding the Error

```
Could not find matching constructor for: org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.PreResolvedResolvableArtifact(...)
```

This error means that the plugin you are using, `com.github.kezong:fat-aar`, is trying to use a piece of Gradle's internal code that has been changed or removed in the version of Gradle you are using.

The "fat-aar" plugin by `com.github.kezong` is no longer actively maintained and has not been updated to work with recent versions of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) and the underlying Gradle build tool. When you use a modern version of Android Studio, you get a new version of Gradle, which causes this old plugin to break.

### The Solution: Switch to a Modern, Maintained "Fat AAR" Plugin

The solution is to replace the outdated plugin with a modern one that serves the same purpose and is compatible with the latest Gradle versions. A highly recommended and well-maintained alternative is **`com.jeovanimartins.fat-aar-plugin`**.

Here is the step-by-step guide to migrating to this new plugin.

#### Step 1: Remove the Old Plugin from Your Root `build.gradle`

Go to your project's **root** `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file and remove the classpath dependency for the old plugin.

**DELETE this from your root `build.gradle`:**

```groovy
// DELETE THIS BLOCK
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        // DELETE THIS LINE
        classpath("com.github.kezong:fat-aar:1.3.8")
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Add and Apply the New Plugin in Your `:core` Module

Now, go to the `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file for your **`:core`** module. You will apply the new plugin here directly.

**In your `:core` module's `build.gradle.kts`:**

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.library")
    kotlin("android")
    // REMOVE the old id("com.kezong.fat-aar")
    // ADD the new plugin id
    id("com.jeovanimartins.fat-aar-plugin") version "1.2.1" // Use the latest version
}

// ... rest of your android { ... } block
```

**In your `:core` module's `build.gradle` (Groovy):**

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.android.library'
    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android'
    // REMOVE the old apply plugin: 'com.kezong.fat-aar'
    // ADD the new plugin id
    id 'com.jeovanimartins.fat-aar-plugin' version '1.2.1' // Use the latest version
}

// ... rest of your android { ... } block
```

**Note:** You can check for the latest version of the plugin on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.jeovanimartins.fat-aar-plugin).

#### Step 3: Verify Your Dependencies (No Changes Likely Needed)

The new plugin smartly reuses the standard Gradle dependency configurations. Your existing `embed` dependencies should work as is. If you run into issues, the standard approach is to use `implementation` and then specify the projects to bundle in a configuration block.

Your dependencies in the `:core` module's `build.gradle` should look like this (and likely require no changes):

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies

    // These should work correctly with the new plugin
    implementation(project(":capture"))
    implementation(project(":network"))
    implementation(project(":security"))
    implementation(project(":embedding"))
    implementation(project(":utility"))
}
```

#### Step 4: Configure the New Plugin (If Needed)

The `com.jeovanimartins.fat-aar-plugin` is designed to work out-of-the-box by automatically embedding all your local project and external library dependencies. If you need more fine-grained control, you can add a `fatAar` configuration block.

For your use case of embedding all your local library modules, the default behavior is exactly what you want, and you likely **do not need this block**. All projects declared with `implementation` will be bundled.

```groovy
// This block is optional, as the default behavior is to embed all dependencies.
// Add it to your :core module's build.gradle if you need custom configuration.
fatAar {
    // For example, to exclude a specific library from being embedded
    // exclude 'group:name:version'
}
```

#### Step 5: Sync Gradle and Rebuild

After making these changes, sync your project with the Gradle files. Then, build your project again using the same command:

```bash
./gradlew :core:assembleRelease
```

The error should now be resolved, and you will find your combined AAR file in the `:core/build/outputs/aar/` directory, just as before. This new AAR will be correctly built using a plugin that is compatible with your modern Gradle environment.
