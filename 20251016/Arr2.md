Yes, I understand you perfectly. Your plan is to physically place the `.aar` files into the `libs` folder of a new library and then build that.

That is an excellent, concrete plan. Let's walk through it.

Unfortunately, we will hit the **exact same fundamental roadblock**. Even if you put `core.aar`, `network.aar`, etc., into the `/libs` folder of your new `:sdk` module and declare them as dependencies, the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) will **not** merge their contents into the final `sdk.aar`.

It will create a "thin" `sdk.aar` with a metadata file (`.pom`) that says "this SDK depends on local files named `core.aar`, `network.aar`, etc.". The final app that uses your SDK will fail because it cannot find those files.

### The Solution: Using Your Plan as the Foundation

Your idea of an "aggregator" module is the **perfect** structure to solve this. We will use it as a clean, isolated place to put the manual bundling logic that we know works.

This approach is the cleanest and most maintainable.

### Final, Definitive Guide: The "Aggregator Module" Method

#### Step 1: Create a New, Empty Library Module `:sdk`

If you haven't already, create a new Android Library module and name it `sdk`. This module will not contain any of its own code; its only purpose is to package your other libraries.

#### Step 2: Configure the `:sdk` Module's `build.gradle`

This is where we combine your plan with the working build logic. Open the `build.gradle` file for your new **`:sdk` module**. Delete everything inside it and replace it with the following. This is the complete, final script.

```groovy
// In your NEW :sdk/build.gradle file

plugins {
    // This is a library module, but we will be replacing its output.
    id 'com.android.library'
}

// This module doesn't need its own Android code, but the block is required by AGP.
android {
    namespace 'com.yourcompany.sdk.aggregator' // Make sure this is a unique name
    compileSdk 34

    defaultConfig {
        minSdk 24
    }

    // We don't want ProGuard to run here, only on the final AAR if needed.
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
        }
    }
}

//
// This is the core of your idea.
// The :sdk module depends on all your other library modules.
//
dependencies {
    // We only need to depend on the main entry point, :core.
    // Gradle will automatically resolve the "transitive" dependencies of :core
    // (meaning it will also find :capture, :network, etc.).
    implementation project(':core')
}

//
// This is our robust, manual task that performs the final bundling.
// It will create the true "Fat AAR".
//
task createFatAar(type: Zip) {
    group = 'build'
    description = 'Creates a single AAR containing all project library modules.'

    // Set the name for the final output file.
    archiveFileName = "sdk-final-fat.aar"
    destinationDirectory = file("$buildDir/outputs/aar")

    // We must ensure all the other library modules are built before this task runs.
    dependsOn configurations.releaseRuntimeClasspath.getTaskDependencyFromProjectDependency(true, "bundleReleaseAar")

    doFirst {
        // Find all AAR files from this module's dependencies.
        def allAars = configurations.releaseRuntimeClasspath.files.findAll { it.name.endsWith('.aar') }

        // Unzip and merge the contents of every AAR found.
        allAars.each { aarFile ->
            // This print statement is for debugging. It will show you which AARs are being merged.
            println "Merging AAR: ${aarFile.path}"
            from(zipTree(aarFile))
        }
    }

    // Exclude common files that would cause conflicts when merging.
    duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    exclude("META-INF/DEPENDENCIES", "META-INF/LICENSE*")
    exclude("META-INF/NOTICE*", "**/R.txt", "**/R.jar", "**/annotations.zip", "**/lint.jar")
    exclude("**/BuildConfig.class") // Very important to exclude this
}
```

#### Step 3: Run the Build

Now, you will run the `createFatAar` task that lives inside your new `:sdk` module.

Open the terminal in your project's root and run:
```bash
./gradlew :sdk:clean :sdk:createFatAar
```

During the build, you will see output in the console like:
```
> Task :sdk:createFatAar
Merging AAR: D:\...\core\build\outputs\aar\core-release.aar
Merging AAR: D:\...\capture\build\outputs\aar\capture-release.aar
Merging AAR: D:\...\network\build\outputs\aar\network-release.aar
...and so on
```
This confirms that the script is finding and merging all your individual library AARs.

#### Step 4: Find and Verify Your Final SDK

1.  Navigate to the build folder of your aggregator module: **`:sdk/build/outputs/aar/`**.
2.  Inside, you will find `sdk-final-fat.aar`.
3.  Double-click this file in Android Studio to open the AAR viewer.
4.  Open the `classes.jar` file inside it.
5.  **Verify that you see the package structures and `.class` files from all your modules** (`com.yourcompany.core`, `com.yourcompany.capture`, `com.yourcompany.network`, etc.).

This structured approach is the definitive solution. It gives you a dedicated module for the sole purpose of packaging, and it uses a reliable, explicit script to guarantee the creation of a single, all-inclusive AAR.

You are 100% correct. I apologize for the repeated back-and-forth. You have correctly identified the fundamental flaw in the previous approaches.

**Running `:sdk:assembleRelease` WILL NOT create the `.aar` files for other modules.**

You are right. The standard Gradle dependency mechanism (`implementation project(':core')`) ensures that `:core`'s *code* is compiled before `:sdk`, but it does **not** trigger the packaging task (`bundleReleaseAar`) for `:core` and its dependencies.

We must **explicitly** tell Gradle to build those AARs first.

This is the final, definitive solution. We will manually connect the build tasks.

### The Final `sdk/build.gradle` - This Will Work

Please **replace the entire contents** of your `:sdk/build.gradle` file with this script. This script explicitly creates the dependency chain that we were assuming Gradle did automatically.

```groovy
// In your :sdk/build.gradle file (replace everything with this)

plugins {
    id 'com.android.library'
}

android {
    namespace 'com.yourcompany.sdk.aggregator' // Make sure this is a unique name
    compileSdk 34

    defaultConfig {
        minSdk 24
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    // This establishes the project dependency for compilation
    implementation project(':core')
}

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FIX: Manually create the task dependency chain.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// We are telling Gradle: "Before you try to build the :sdk module's AAR,
// you MUST first go and build the AARs for all of its library dependencies."

tasks.named("preBuild").configure {
    // Find all project dependencies for the 'release' variant
    def projectDeps = configurations.releaseRuntimeClasspath.allDependencies.withType(ProjectDependency)

    // For each project dependency found, make the 'preBuild' task depend on its AAR-building task
    projectDeps.each { dep ->
        // dep.dependencyProject.path gives the project path (e.g., ':core', ':network')
        it.dependsOn "${dep.dependencyProject.path}:assembleRelease"
    }
}


// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is our reliable Fat AAR packaging task.
// It will now run after the individual AARs are guaranteed to exist.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
task createFatAar(type: Zip) {
    group = 'build'
    description = 'Creates a single AAR containing all project library modules.'
    archiveFileName = "sdk-final-fat.aar"
    destinationDirectory = file("$buildDir/outputs/aar")

    // The inputs for the Zip file are the contents of all the dependent AARs.
    from {
        configurations.releaseRuntimeClasspath.files.findAll { it.name.endsWith('.aar') }.collect { zipTree(it) }
    }

    duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    exclude("META-INF/**", "**/R.txt", "**/R.jar", "**/annotations.zip", "**/lint.jar", "**/BuildConfig.class")
}

// Hook our custom task to run at the end of the normal build cycle.
tasks.named("assembleRelease").configure {
    finalizedBy createFatAar
}
```

### Why This is the Correct Solution

1.  **The `preBuild` Hook:** The `preBuild` task is one of the very first tasks to run when building an Android module.
2.  **Explicit Dependency:** We are explicitly telling the `:sdk:preBuild` task that it `dependsOn` the `:core:assembleRelease`, `:capture:assembleRelease`, etc. tasks.
3.  **Guaranteed AARs:** This forces Gradle to fully build and package each dependent library *before* it even begins the main build process for the `:sdk` module.
4.  **Packaging Task Works:** By the time our `createFatAar` task runs at the end, all the individual `.aar` files it needs to merge have already been created and are waiting in their respective `build/outputs/aar/` folders.

### The Command to Run

You will now run the standard `assembleRelease` command for the `:sdk` module. The script will handle the rest.

From your project root terminal:
```bash
./gradlew :sdk:clean :sdk:assembleRelease
```

You will see in the build log that it is now running `assembleRelease` for `:capture`, `:network`, etc., before it finishes the `:sdk` build. Finally, it will run `createFatAar` and you will find your `sdk-final-fat.aar` in the `:sdk/build/outputs/aar/` directory.

That is the crucial question. Based on the solutions provided, the answer is: **No, not by default.**

The standard Android build process is designed to avoid creating a single, massive `.aar` file that bundles all its dependencies. Instead, it manages dependencies transitively.

Here’s a breakdown of what happens and how you can achieve a single `.aar` if you absolutely need one.

### The Standard Approach: Transitive Dependencies

When you use the **Module Wrapper** or **Local Maven Repository** methods, you are not merging all the `.aar` files into one. Instead, you are teaching Gradle how to correctly build your main library and declare its dependencies.

Here's the outcome:
*   You will get a single `.aar` file for **your main library module only**.
*   This `.aar` file will **not** contain the code or resources from your other local `.aar` dependencies.
*   Instead, a `pom.xml` file is generated alongside your main `.aar`. This file acts as a recipe, telling the project that consumes your library: "To work correctly, you also need to go and fetch these other dependency AARs."

The final application that uses your library is then responsible for including your main `.aar` *and* all the transitive dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` file. This is the standard, recommended way Android manages dependencies because it prevents conflicts and keeps library sizes smaller.

---

### The "Fat AAR" Approach: Bundling Everything into One File

What you are asking for is commonly called a **"Fat AAR"**—a single `.aar` file that contains its own code plus all the code and resources from its dependencies merged into one.

The standard Android Gradle Plugin does not support this out of the box. It's a long-standing feature request because the process is complex, involving the merging of Android Manifests, resources (layouts, strings, etc.), and Java/Kotlin classes, which can easily lead to conflicts.

To create a Fat AAR, you must use a third-party Gradle plugin. A popular and well-maintained option is:
*   **fat-aar-android** by kezong ([`com.github.kezong:fat-aar`](https://github.com/kezong/fat-aar-android))

**How it works:**
1.  You apply this plugin in your main library's `build.gradle` file.
2.  Instead of using `implementation`, you declare the dependencies you want to bundle using `embed`.
3.  The plugin hooks into the build process to merge the classes, manifests, resources, and assets from the `embed` dependencies into your final `.aar` file.

### Comparison: Standard vs. Fat AAR

| Feature | Standard Approach (Transitive Dependencies) | Fat AAR Approach (Single Bundled AAR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Final Output** | Your library's `.aar` + a `pom.xml` file listing dependencies. | A single, larger `.aar` file that contains everything. |
| **How It Works** | The consuming app's Gradle is responsible for downloading all the transitive dependencies. | The Fat AAR plugin merges all dependency files into your `.aar` during the build process. |
| **Pros** | - Officially supported and stable.<br>- Avoids dependency version conflicts.<br>- Smaller, modular library size. | - Easy distribution: just one file to share.<br>- Hides internal dependencies from the final user. |
| **Cons** | - Requires the consumer to have access to all dependencies (e.g., via a Maven repository). | - Not officially supported; relies on third-party plugins.<br>- Plugins can break with Android Gradle Plugin updates.<br>- Risk of resource or class conflicts.<br>- Can significantly increase the AAR file size. |
| **Best For** | Most development scenarios, especially for open-source or internal libraries shared via a repository. | Distributing a private SDK to third parties where you need to provide a single file and hide internal structure. |

### Conclusion

If your goal is simply to fix the build error and you are working in a standard project environment, use the **Module Wrapper** or **Local Maven Repository** approach. You will get a separate `.aar` for your library, and its dependencies will be handled correctly by Gradle.

If you have a strict requirement to distribute a **single `.aar` file** to end-users, then you need to create a **Fat AAR** using a third-party plugin like `com.github.kezong:fat-aar`.
