Excellent question. This is a very common and important problem in specialized computer vision applications. You've correctly observed that a fixed distance range (like 10-15cm) is not a robust solution because the visual size of your overlay is tied to the screen's physical properties, not the camera's.

The solution is to **calculate the optimal distance dynamically by working backwards from the desired visual appearance on the screen.**

Instead of saying "the finger must be 10cm away," we will say, "the finger, when at the optimal distance, should appear to be the same width as the overlay box on the screen." We can then calculate what that distance is for any given device.

Here is the step-by-step logic and implementation.

### The Core Concept: From Screen Appearance to Real-World Distance

1.  **Define an Anchor:** The non-scalable overlay `Rect` on your screen is our anchor. Its width in **pixels** is what the user sees as the target.
2.  **Define a Constant:** We need a known real-world dimension to anchor our calculation. The user's finger is the object, so we must assume an **average finger width**. This is a reasonable physical constant. Let's assume an average adult index finger is about **16 mm** wide.
3.  **Relate Screen to Sensor:** We need to figure out what the overlay's width in screen pixels corresponds to in terms of the camera sensor's pixels. This depends on how the camera preview is scaled to fit the screen view.
4.  **Calculate Distance:** Once we have a target *perceived pixel width on the sensor*, we can use our existing distance formula in reverse to find the one single distance that would produce that exact pixel width for an object of 16mm.

This calculated distance becomes our dynamic "optimal focus distance."

### Step-by-Step Dynamic Calculation

This calculation should be done **once** when your camera preview and overlay are set up.

#### Step 1: Define Your Physical Constant

In your `CameraActivity.kt` or a constants file:

```kotlin
// The assumed average width of an adult index finger in millimeters.
// This is a crucial assumption. You can tune it for your user base.
private const val AVG_FINGER_WIDTH_MM = 16.0
```

#### Step 2: Get All Necessary Dimensions (in Android)

You need to get the dimensions after the UI has been laid out. A `View.post` or `OnGlobalLayoutListener` is a perfect place for this.

```kotlin
// Member variables to hold our calculated safe distance range
private var minSafeDistanceCm: Double = 0.0
private var maxSafeDistanceCm: Double = 0.0

// Assume you have these from your Camera2 setup
private var cameraImageWidth: Int = 0 // e.g., 1920 (width of the image from ImageReader)
private lateinit var previewView: TextureView // Your camera preview view
private lateinit var overlayView: View // Your non-scalable overlay view

private fun calculateOptimalFocusDistance() {
    // Ensure all dimensions are available before calculating
    if (cameraImageWidth == 0 || previewView.width == 0 || overlayView.width == 0 || sensorWidth == 0f) {
        Log.e("FocusCalc", "Cannot calculate distance, dimensions are not ready.")
        return
    }

    // 1. Get the width of the overlay in screen pixels.
    val overlayWidthOnScreenPixels = overlayView.width.toDouble()

    // 2. Calculate the target width of the finger on the CAMERA SENSOR.
    // This scales the overlay's screen size to the camera's image size.
    // This assumes your previewView is using a scale type like centerCrop.
    val targetFingerWidthOnSensorPixels = overlayWidthOnScreenPixels * (cameraImageWidth.toDouble() / previewView.width.toDouble())

    // 3. Use the distance formula in reverse.
    // Distance = (Focal_Length * Real_Width * Image_Width) / (Perceived_Width * Sensor_Width)
    // We are solving for Distance given a target Perceived_Width.
    
    val optimalDistanceMm = (lensFocalLength * AVG_FINGER_WIDTH_MM * cameraImageWidth) /
                              (targetFingerWidthOnSensorPixels * sensorWidth)

    // 4. Create a "safe range" around this optimal distance.
    // For example, a +/- 20% tolerance.
    val tolerance = 0.20 
    minSafeDistanceCm = (optimalDistanceMm * (1.0 - tolerance)) / 10.0
    maxSafeDistanceCm = (optimalDistanceMm * (1.0 + tolerance)) / 10.0

    Log.d("FocusCalc", "Optimal Distance Calculated: ${optimalDistanceMm / 10.0} cm")
    Log.d("FocusCalc", "Safe Range: $minSafeDistanceCm cm to $maxSafeDistanceCm cm")
}
```
**When to call this function?**
After your camera is set up and your UI is drawn. For example, in your `onSurfaceTextureAvailable` listener, you can post it to the view's message queue.

```kotlin
previewView.post {
    // Get cameraImageWidth from your chosen StreamConfigurationMap size
    cameraImageWidth = previewSize.width 
    calculateOptimalFocusDistance()
}
```

#### Step 3: Update the Real-Time Check

Your Python script (`main.py`) **does not need to change at all**. It is already correctly calculating the real-time distance.

You only need to change the Android code that *interprets* the result from Python.

```kotlin
// Inside your onImageAvailableListener
private val onImageAvailableListener = ImageReader.OnImageAvailableListener { reader ->
    // ... get image, throttle frames, call python ...

    val resultObj: PyObject? = pyModule.callAttr(...)
    
    if (resultObj != null) {
        val resultMap = resultObj.asMap()
        val distanceCm = resultMap[PyObject.fromJava("distance_cm")]?.toDouble()
        val boxList = resultMap[PyObject.fromJava("box")]?.asList()

        if (distanceCm != null && boxList != null) {
            // --- THE CRITICAL CHECK ---
            // Check if the measured distance is within our dynamically calculated safe range.
            val isDistanceSafe = distanceCm >= minSafeDistanceCm && distanceCm <= maxSafeDistanceCm
            
            // Also get camera focus state
            val focusState = latestCaptureResult?.get(CaptureResult.CONTROL_AF_STATE)
            val isFocusLocked = focusState != null && 
                               (focusState == CaptureResult.CONTROL_AF_STATE_FOCUSED_LOCKED ||
                                focusState == CaptureResult.CONTROL_AF_STATE_PASSIVE_FOCUSED)

            runOnUiThread {
                updateUiWithDistance(distanceCm, boxList.map { it.toInt() }.toIntArray(), isDistanceSafe, isFocusLocked)
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}

private fun updateUiWithDistance(distance: Double, box: IntArray, isDistanceSafe: Boolean, isFocusLocked: Boolean) {
    // Provide feedback to the user
    val statusText: String
    if (!isDistanceSafe) {
        statusText = if (distance < minSafeDistanceCm) "Move finger further away" else "Move finger closer"
        captureButton.isEnabled = false
    } else if (!isFocusLocked) {
        statusText = "Hold still, focusing..."
        captureButton.isEnabled = false
    } else {
        statusText = "Ready to capture!"
        captureButton.isEnabled = true
    }
    
    // Display statusText and distance on your overlay...
}
```

### Important Bonus: Hardware Minimum Focus Distance

Camera2 also tells you the absolute closest the lens can possibly focus. This is a great hard limit to check against.

In your `setupCameraParameters` function:

```kotlin
// Member variable
private var minFocusDistanceCm = 0.0f

// Inside setupCameraParameters
val minFocusDist = characteristics.get(CameraCharacteristics.LENS_INFO_MINIMUM_FOCUS_DISTANCE)
if (minFocusDist != null && minFocusDist > 0) {
    // The value is in diopters (1/meters), so we invert it to get meters, then convert to cm.
    this.minFocusDistanceCm = (1 / minFocusDist) * 100
    Log.d("CameraParams", "Hardware Minimum Focus Distance: $minFocusDistanceCm cm")
}
```
You can then use this to ensure your calculated `minSafeDistanceCm` is not less than the hardware limit.

```kotlin
// Inside calculateOptimalFocusDistance, after calculating minSafeDistanceCm
minSafeDistanceCm = max(minSafeDistanceCm, minFocusDistanceCm.toDouble())
```

### Summary of the Workflow

1.  **On Startup:**
    *   Get physical camera parameters (`focal_length`, `sensor_width`, `min_focus_distance`).
    *   Once the UI is drawn, get the pixel widths of your `previewView` and `overlayView`.
    *   Call `calculateOptimalFocusDistance()` to compute `minSafeDistanceCm` and `maxSafeDistanceCm` for the current device.

2.  **In Real-Time (on each processed frame):**
    *   Your Python script detects the finger and calculates its current `distanceCm`.
    *   Your Android code receives this distance.
    *   It compares the `distanceCm` against the pre-calculated `minSafeDistanceCm` and `maxSafeDistanceCm`.
    *   It also checks the camera's `CONTROL_AF_STATE`.
    *   If both conditions (distance is safe AND focus is locked) are met, you enable the capture button. Otherwise, you provide helpful UI feedback to the user.
